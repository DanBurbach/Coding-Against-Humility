              have to give us credit, you canâ€™t profit from the use of our

              This bearing in mind, I would like to thank the people of Cards
              Against Humanity for being supportive in the creation of their
              game and allowing people such as myself to create games like
              this for free distrubution and in celebration of their creation.
              I would also like to thank{" "}

              </a>{" "}
              <a href="https://crhallberg.com/">(Chris Hallberg)</a> for
              providing an Open Source JSON which is the library that this
