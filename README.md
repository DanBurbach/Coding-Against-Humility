# Coding Against Humility

### __Created by Dan Burbach__

Epicodus Final Capstone Project

education, work experience, and your technical/personal interests.

## __Description__

  This site will list my coding projects, education, work experience, and your technical/personal interests.

  Using [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), I created a tree component chart to detail the layout of the routing and connectivity:

  ![Component Tree]()

## __Future Development__

  * Fade in from bottom effect on load of pages

  * Integration of screenshots, images, and main splash page having linked images to each other page (besides relying just on navbar)

  * Dynamic flow of content (Parallax perfected on each page)

  * Form of contact email looking more presentable

  - Possibilities:

  * Make everything on just one page with click to section of page. Limiting routing and excess code.

## __Setup/Installation Requirements__

  * Clone repository

  * Open terminal

  * Run npm install

  * npm run start

  * Open a browser: http://localhost:8080/

  * Enjoy!
